<!--
**FERDdeveloper/FERDdeveloper** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ferderclient, PhobosC
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, school things
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about FFC
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/Them
- âš¡ Fun fact: i'm non-binary :)
